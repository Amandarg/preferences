    "# Overview\n",
    "This code cleans the paired comparison data from shiny2 and shiny3 from this [paper](https://gking.harvard.edu/publications/how-measure-legislative-district-compactness-if-you-only-know-it-when-you-see-it). In particular, it creates a new csv called `paired_comparisons.csv` whose columns are \n",
    "\n",
    "`['id', 'study', 'district1', 'district2', 'winner', 'alternate_id_1', 'alternate_id_2', 'alternate_id_winner']`\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "* `id` = anonymized id of person answering questions. Note, id `hyF6TZwPOEVS` was used as an id for 16 respondants in shiny3 though Aaron says this is truly from 16 different people.\n",
    "* `study` = shiny2 or shiny3 indicating which study the data was from\n",
    "* `district1` and `district2` are the two districts shown in the pairwise comparison question in the format of `FIPS_[0 if lower chamber, 1 if upper chamber]_districtnumber.jpg`\n",
    "* `winner` = the district out of the two that was chosen as *more* compact\n",
    "* `alternate_id_1`, `alternate_id_2`, `alternate_id_winner` = `FIPS_[L/U/C for lower, upper, congressional]_districtnumber_year`. We need this alternate id in order to get the features for each district based on `preds_6_14_18.RData`. The value in this column will be equal to the value in the `disctrict` column in `preds_6_14_18.RData`. I decided to make this a separate column since it was not straight forward to translate the old naming convention to the new naming convention as discussed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need the following folders and package though you will have to change the directories of these folders in the code because the code depends on my directories:\n",
    "* `grey maps`\n",
    "* `paired_comparisons/shiny_results2/`\n",
    "* `paired_comparisons/shiny_results3/`\n",
    "* `preds_6_14_18.RData`\n",
    "* `pyreadr` (library for extracting `.RData` data into python)\n",
    "    \n",
    "See the cells below for information about each study, i.e. how many people, how many questions each person answered, and how many unique districts showed up in the questions. There is no overlap between the districts used in shiny2 vs shiny3."

It appears to be the former based on some manual checking but also there was a file whose first two rows was the same district. I assume they would not ask the same district in a pairwise comparison. Aaron said whatever convention was used should be consistent from study to study."

This is an issue since the same district from different years can have widley different features. Aaron said \"[the years] will be from the chambers of the state legislature (rather than Congress) from either 2000-2010 or 2010-2020 election cycles.\" He suggested to match up the district names in shiny2 and shiny3 to file names in `grey maps`, which is a folder of district images. \n",

    "Each district in shiny2 and shiny3 matched to at least one file `grey maps`. However, in some cases there were two matches, i.e. there was an image of that district for two different years. Fortunately, only one of the years existed in `preds_6_14_18.RData`, so hopefully this is reliable. My only hesitation to all of this is that I noticed in `grey_maps`, there were slightly different file names by appending a `0` to parts of the file name for what I would assume describes the same district though based on the actual images this sort of does not seem to be the case. For instance, there are two files called `01_L_14_2000.jpg` and `01_L_014_2000.jpg` that differ by a `0` and the images of these two files are actually quite different, though similar.\n"
